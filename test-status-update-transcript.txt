David: Good morning everyone. Let's go through our progress updates.

Lisa: I finished the database schema design yesterday. All tables are created and the foreign keys are set up correctly.

David: That's great news, Lisa! What about the API endpoints?

Lisa: The user authentication API is complete. I wrapped it up this morning. All endpoints are tested and working.

James: I'm currently working on the frontend dashboard. About 60% done so far. I've completed the navigation and sidebar, still need to finish the data tables.

David: When do you think you'll have it ready?

James: I should be done by end of week. Almost finished with the core components.

Lisa: I did run into one blocker though. The email service integration is stuck - we're waiting for IT to provide the API credentials.

David: Oh no, how long has that been blocked?

Lisa: Since Monday. I can't proceed with the notification system until we get those credentials.

David: Okay, I'll follow up with IT today. David will contact IT about email API credentials.

James: One more thing - I completed the user profile page as well. It's fully functional now.

Lisa: Nice work! And I also finished documenting the API endpoints. The documentation is published on our wiki.

David: Excellent. So to summarize:
- Lisa: Database schema done, auth API complete, email service blocked
- James: Dashboard 60% complete, user profile done
- Need: IT credentials for email service

Let's meet again Friday to check on the dashboard progress.

James: Sounds good. I'll keep pushing on the frontend.

Lisa: I'll start on the reporting module while waiting for those credentials.

Meeting adjourned.
