# Multi-Project Tracker

## Overview

Multi-Project Tracker is an AI-powered issue tracking system with comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The application provides a centralized platform for tracking issues and action items across different projects, with built-in AI capabilities for enhanced project management. The system features a clean, responsive web interface built with modern frontend technologies, a secure Node.js backend with JWT authentication, and persistent PostgreSQL database storage with full role-based permission enforcement.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built as a single-page application (SPA) using vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling:
- **Core Logic**: `app.js` - Project management, UI rendering, modal controls
- **Authentication**: `auth.js` - AuthManager with role checking, login/register/logout flows
- **UI Components**: `index.html` - Responsive layout with role-based visibility controls
- **Permission System**: Dynamic UI updates based on user role and authentication status
  - Login/Register/Logout modals with form validation
  - Role badges displayed for authenticated users
  - Conditional rendering of action buttons (create, edit, delete) based on permissions
  - User management interface for System Administrators
- **HTTP Communication**: Fetch API with credentials for cookie-based auth
- **Event Handling**: Event delegation for efficient DOM manipulation

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API architecture built on Express.js with PostgreSQL database (Neon). The application implements a layered architecture with:
- Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- JWT authentication with httpOnly cookie-based session management
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) middleware with 6-tier role hierarchy
- Database access layer using Drizzle ORM
- Comprehensive request validation and error handling

### Security Implementation
The application implements comprehensive security measures including:
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored in httpOnly cookies with SameSite=Lax and Secure flag in production
- **Password Security**: bcryptjs hashing with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **RBAC System**: 6-tier role hierarchy with granular permission enforcement
  - System Administrator (highest): Full system access, user management
  - Project Manager: Create/delete projects, manage all content
  - Team Lead: Edit any issues, moderate content
  - Team Member: Create issues, edit own content
  - Stakeholder: Read-only project access with comments
  - External Viewer (lowest): Read-only access
- **API Protection**: Helmet.js security headers, CORS configuration, rate limiting (100 req/15min)
- **Input Validation**: Joi schema validation for all endpoints
- **Authorization**: Role-based middleware protecting all sensitive endpoints

### Data Management
PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM provides:
- **Users table**: Authentication credentials, roles, profile data with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- **Projects table**: Project metadata, templates, timestamps
- **Issues table**: Issue tracking with status, priority, assignments
- **Action Items table**: Granular action item tracking linked to issues and projects
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints ensuring data integrity
- **Migrations**: Schema managed through Drizzle with safe push/pull capabilities

### Request Handling
The application uses express-rate-limit for API protection and implements proper error handling middleware. Request body parsing is configured with size limits (10MB) and supports both JSON and URL-encoded data formats.
