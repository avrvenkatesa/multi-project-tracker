# Multi-Project Tracker

## Overview
Multi-Project Tracker is an AI-powered issue tracking system designed to centralize and streamline project management. It features comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), a responsive web interface, a secure Node.js backend with JWT authentication, and persistent PostgreSQL storage. The system includes advanced AI meeting analysis with two-phase processing (item extraction + status update detection), in-modal search for matching items, and a persistent review queue for unmatched status updates. The system aims to enhance project oversight and efficiency through AI-driven insights and robust security measures, thereby enhancing project oversight and efficiency.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend
The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, featuring a dynamic UI based on user roles and authentication. Key features include AI analysis capabilities (in-modal search, review queue, smart matching, relationship detection), a comprehensive comment system with markdown support and real-time @mention autocomplete, and a Project Dashboard with analytics, Chart.js visualizations, activity feed, and team performance metrics.

### Backend
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js, utilizing a PostgreSQL database via Drizzle ORM. It employs a layered architecture with security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting), JWT authentication with httpOnly cookie-based session management, and a 6-tier RBAC system for granular permissions. Joi is used for request validation, and bcryptjs for password hashing.

### Data Management
A PostgreSQL database stores core entities such as Users, Projects, Issues, Action Items, Meeting Transcripts, and the Risk Register. It also handles relationships (including AI-generated), AI-specific data (Status Update Review Queue, AI analysis audit trail), collaboration data (comments, mention notifications), user preferences, and comprehensive risk management with automatic risk scoring and tracking.

### Request Handling
Express.js handles requests, incorporating `express-rate-limit` for API protection and comprehensive error handling. It supports JSON and URL-encoded data parsing.
