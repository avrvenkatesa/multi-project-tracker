# Multi-Project Tracker

## Overview
Multi-Project Tracker is an AI-powered issue tracking system designed to centralize and streamline project management. It features comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), a responsive web interface, a secure Node.js backend with JWT authentication, and persistent PostgreSQL storage. The system includes advanced AI meeting analysis with two-phase processing (item extraction + status update detection), in-modal search for matching items, and a persistent review queue for unmatched status updates. The system aims to enhance project oversight and efficiency through AI-driven insights and robust security measures.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS, featuring a dynamic UI based on user roles and authentication. Key features include AI analysis capabilities (in-modal search, review queue, smart matching, relationship detection), a comprehensive comment system with markdown support and real-time @mention autocomplete, and a Project Dashboard with analytics, Chart.js visualizations, activity feed, and team performance metrics. Kanban boards include automatic due date sorting with color-coded visual indicators for urgency and attachment count badges.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is a RESTful API built with Express.js, utilizing a PostgreSQL database via Drizzle ORM. It employs a layered architecture with security middleware (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting), JWT authentication with httpOnly cookie-based session management, and a 6-tier RBAC system for granular permissions. Joi is used for request validation, and bcryptjs for password hashing. File attachment functionality is implemented with Multer for secure uploads, supporting various file types with size limits and unique filename generation. AI-powered meeting transcript analysis leverages OpenAI for extracting and updating project items.

## Recent Changes

### Feature: Phase 2 - User-Controlled Sort Options (October 9, 2025)
Implemented user-controlled sort dropdown with 7 sort modes and localStorage persistence:
- **Sort Modes Available**: Each Kanban column header now includes a dropdown with 7 sorting options:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Due Date (Overdue First) - Default from Phase 1, prioritizes overdue items
  - üìÖ Due Date (Earliest) - All items sorted by due date ascending (null dates last)
  - üìÖ Due Date (Latest) - All items sorted by due date descending (null dates last)
  - üî• Priority - Sort by priority level (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
  - üÜï Recently Created - Newest items first (created_at descending)
  - üïê Recently Updated - Most recently updated first (updated_at descending)
  - ‚úã Manual - Preserves current order (full drag-drop reordering planned for Phase 3)
- **Per-Column Preferences**: Each column can have an independent sort mode (e.g., To Do sorted by priority, In Progress by due date)
- **localStorage Persistence**: User's sort preferences saved to browser localStorage and restored on page reload
- **Dynamic Item Counts**: Column headers show live item counts (e.g., "To Do (5)")
- **Responsive Design**: Sort dropdowns styled with mobile breakpoints for smaller screens
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - sortItems() function handles all 7 sort modes with array copies to prevent mutation
  - getSortPreference() / saveSortPreference() manage localStorage persistence
  - Manual mode preserves order when switching modes and moving between columns
  - TODO: Full drag-drop reordering within same column (Phase 3 enhancement)
- **Files Updated**: `public/app.js` (v26) - added sort functions and preference management; `public/index.html` - added column header dropdowns with item counts and CSS styling
- **Impact**: Users can customize Kanban sorting per column, with preferences persisting across sessions for personalized workflow management

### Feature: Phase 1 - Kanban Due Date Auto-Sorting with Visual Indicators (October 9, 2025)
Implemented automatic due date sorting and color-coded visual indicators for the Kanban board:
- **Sorting Logic**: Items in each Kanban column are automatically grouped and sorted by due date urgency:
  - Overdue items (due_date < today): Displayed first, oldest overdue items at top
  - Due today items (due_date = today): Shown after overdue
  - Upcoming items (due_date > today): Sorted by soonest first
  - No due date items (due_date is null): Displayed at bottom
- **Visual Badges**: Every issue and action item card displays a color-coded due date badge:
  - üî¥ Overdue: Red badge (#fee2e2 bg, #dc2626 text) - shows "X days overdue"
  - üü° Today: Yellow/amber badge (#fef3c7 bg, #d97706 text) - shows "Due today"
  - üü† Soon (1-3 days): Orange badge (#fef3c7 bg, #f59e0b text) - shows "Due tomorrow" or "Due in X days"
  - üîµ Future (3+ days): Blue badge (#dbeafe bg, #2563eb text) - shows "Due in X days"
  - ‚ö™ None: Gray badge (#f3f4f6 bg, #6b7280 text) - shows "No due date"
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Added `sortByDueDate()` function that partitions items into buckets using normalized midnight date comparisons
  - Added `createDueDateBadge()` function that generates badge HTML with appropriate icons and text
  - Updated `renderKanbanBoard()` to apply sorting to each column before rendering
  - Badge includes FontAwesome icons (calendar-times, exclamation-circle, calendar-day, clock, calendar)
- **Responsive Design**: CSS includes mobile breakpoint (@media max-width: 768px) with smaller text and padding
- **Files Updated**: `public/app.js` - added sorting and badge functions, updated renderKanbanBoard(); `public/index.html` - added CSS styles for all badge variants
- **Impact**: Users can quickly identify urgent items at a glance with automatic sorting and clear visual indicators for due date status
