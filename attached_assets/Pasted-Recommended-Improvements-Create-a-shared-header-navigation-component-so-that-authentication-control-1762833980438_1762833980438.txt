Recommended Improvements
Create a shared header/navigation component so that authentication controls, dropdowns, and page titles stay visually and behaviorally consistent instead of being reimplemented on every page.

Standardize “Back” navigation patterns (e.g., button placement, iconography, and behavior) instead of mixing inline buttons with separate nav bars across views like the dashboard and notification settings pages.

Adopt a single icon system; pages currently mix emojis and inline SVGs, which fragments the visual language and makes scaling/customization harder.

Define reusable button styles or design tokens so primary, secondary, and danger actions look unified instead of each page crafting its own Tailwind class combination.

Rationalize the color palette by choosing a focused set of brand hues and applying them consistently; today gradients, blues, purples, and greens appear interchangeably in similar components.

Standardize page layout widths and spacing tokens so content blocks align predictably; main areas alternate between max-w-7xl, max-w-4xl, and custom padding without an overarching system.

Unify loading indicators into a single pattern (overlay, spinner, messaging) rather than mixing full-width overlays with inline spinners and text variations across screens.

Create consistent empty-state components with shared illustration/icon styles, copy tone, and call-to-action placement instead of ad-hoc emoji treatments such as the checklists empty state.

Establish a typography scale and usage guide so headers, subheaders, and body text employ predictable sizes and weights instead of varying per page (e.g., text-3xl vs. text-xl vs. text-sm in similar contexts).

Improve accessibility states (focus, aria labeling, keyboard cues) for interactive elements; many buttons only define hover styles and rely on icons/emoji without descriptive labels for screen readers.

These adjustments will make the interface feel cohesive, easier to maintain, and more accessible while aligning with widely accepted UI/UX best practices.
