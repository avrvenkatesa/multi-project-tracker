 CORRECTION PROMPT: Fix Effort Estimation Data Model

  There are two critical bugs in the current implementation that need to be fixed:

  BUG 1: Wrong ai_estimate_version value (Line 151)

  Change line 151 from:
  1
  To:
  0  // Version 0 = heuristic estimate (can be upgraded to detailed AI later)

  This is critical because:
  - Version 0 = Quick complexity-based heuristic (30h/60h/120h)
  - Version 1+ = Detailed AI task decomposition
  - The current code uses heuristic estimation, so it must be version 0

  BUG 2: Wrong database table in schedule generation (Lines 322-328)

  Replace the ENTIRE query from lines 322-328:
  const issuesData = await pool.query(
    `SELECT i.id, i.title, i.assignee, i.due_date,
            e.estimated_hours, e.source as estimate_source
     FROM issues i
     LEFT JOIN effort_estimates e ON i.id = e.issue_id AND e.is_active = TRUE
     WHERE i.id = ANY($1)
     ORDER BY i.id`,
    [result.issues.ids]
  );

  With this corrected query:
  const issuesData = await pool.query(
    `SELECT i.id, i.title, i.assignee, i.due_date,
            i.ai_effort_estimate_hours as estimated_hours,
            CASE
              WHEN i.ai_estimate_version = 0 THEN 'heuristic'
              WHEN i.ai_estimate_version > 0 THEN 'ai'
              ELSE 'manual'
            END as estimate_source
     FROM issues i
     WHERE i.id = ANY($1)
     ORDER BY i.id`,
    [result.issues.ids]
  );

  Why this is critical:
  - The effort_estimates table does NOT exist in the database schema
  - All effort estimates are stored in issues.ai_effort_estimate_hours column
  - The old query would cause a database error when trying to auto-generate schedules

  After making these changes:
  1. The implementation will correctly mark estimates as heuristic (version 0)
  2. Users can later upgrade individual issues to detailed AI estimates (version 1+)
  3. Schedule generation will work correctly using the existing columns
  4. The system maintains a single source of truth for effort data

  Please make these two changes and confirm when complete.
