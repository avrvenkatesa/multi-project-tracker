YES - Proceed with implementing the 7 API endpoints.

Implementation requirements:

CRITICAL: Use the existing authentication and database patterns from server.js:
- Use pool.query() for database access (not Drizzle ORM)
- Use authenticateToken middleware for all endpoints
- Use req.cookies for authentication (cookie-based auth)
- Return proper JSON responses with error handling
- Use bcrypt for any password operations
- Use crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex') for invitation tokens

Endpoint specifications:

1. POST /api/projects/:projectId/team/invite
   - Auth: Manager+ only (check project_members role)
   - Validate: email, role (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer)
   - Check: user not already member, no pending invitation
   - Generate: unique token, expiry 7 days from now
   - Insert into project_invitations
   - Return: invitation object with token

2. POST /api/invitations/:token/accept
   - Auth: any authenticated user
   - Verify: token exists, not expired, email matches logged-in user
   - Insert: into project_members with invited role
   - Update: invitation status to 'accepted', responded_at to now
   - Return: success message with projectId

3. POST /api/invitations/:token/decline
   - Auth: any authenticated user
   - Verify: token exists, not expired
   - Update: invitation status to 'declined', responded_at to now
   - Return: success message

4. PATCH /api/projects/:projectId/team/:memberId/role
   - Auth: Manager+ only, cannot change own role
   - Validate: new role is valid (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer)
   - Check: updater has higher role than target AND new role
   - Update: project_members set role where id = memberId
   - Return: updated member object

5. DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/team/:memberId
   - Auth: Manager+ only, cannot remove self
   - Update: project_members set status='removed', removed_at=now, removed_by=req.user.id
   - Return: success message

6. GET /api/invitations/me
   - Auth: any authenticated user
   - Query: invitations where invitee_email = req.user.email, status='pending', expires_at > now
   - Join: with projects and inviters to get names
   - Return: array of invitation objects

7. GET /api/projects/:projectId/invitations
   - Auth: Manager+ in that project only
   - Query: invitations where project_id = projectId, status='pending', expires_at > now
   - Join: with inviters to get names
   - Return: array of invitation objects

Add all endpoints to server.js after the existing GET /team endpoint.
Include comprehensive error handling and SQL injection prevention.
Log all operations for debugging.

Proceed with implementation.
