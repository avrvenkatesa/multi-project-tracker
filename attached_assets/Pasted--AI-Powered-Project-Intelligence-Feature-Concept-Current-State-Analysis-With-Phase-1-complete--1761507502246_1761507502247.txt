- 3 team members
- Dependencies between tasks
- Working hours/availability

OUTPUT:
- Gantt-style timeline
- Critical path identification
- Milestone dates
- Resource allocation schedule
- Risk-adjusted completion date

Example AI Analysis:
📊 Schedule Analysis for Project "Q4 Launch"

Timeline: Oct 26 - Nov 18, 2025 (24 working days)
Total Effort: 120 hours across 15 tasks
Team Capacity: 3 people × 6 hours/day = 18 hours/day

CRITICAL PATH (8 tasks, 65 hours):
Task #45 → #47 → #52 → #55 → #60 → #62 → #68 → #70

⚠️ Risks Identified:
- Task #52 blocks 4 downstream tasks
- Sarah has 32 hours assigned in Week 1 (160% allocation)
- No buffer time for delays

💡 Recommendations:
1. Start Task #45 immediately (critical path)
2. Reassign 12 hours from Sarah to John (Week 1)
3. Add 2-day buffer before Milestone 2
4. Consider parallel execution for Tasks #48-#51

📅 Projected Completion: Nov 15, 2025
   Risk-adjusted: Nov 18, 2025 (+3 days buffer)


2. Resource Over-Allocation Detection ⚠️
What AI Can Detect:
ANALYSIS: Weekly Resource Allocation

Week of Oct 28:
┌─────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────┐
│ Person  │ Assigned │ Capacity │ Status │
├─────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────┤
│ Sarah   │ 48h      │ 30h      │ 🔴 160%│
│ John    │ 20h      │ 30h      │ 🟢  67%│
│ Mike    │ 12h      │ 30h      │ 🟢  40%│
└─────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────┘

🔴 OVER-ALLOCATED: Sarah
Tasks causing conflict:
- #45: 12h (Due Oct 29)
- #47: 16h (Due Oct 30)
- #52: 20h (Due Nov 1)

💡 Suggested Reallocation:
- Move Task #52 to John (20h available)
- Extend Task #47 deadline by 2 days
- Split Task #45 between Sarah (8h) + Mike (4h)


3. Additional AI-Powered Insights
A. Bottleneck Analysis 🚧
🚧 Bottleneck Alert: Task #52

Impact Analysis:
- Blocks 4 downstream tasks (48 total hours)
- Assigned to: Sarah (currently over-allocated)
- Estimated: 20h | Actual progress: 0h
- Days until deadline: 6 days

Risk Level: HIGH
- 60% probability of delay
- Could push project completion by 1 week

Mitigation Options:
1. Reassign to John (has capacity)
2. Split into 2 smaller tasks
3. Extend deadline and reschedule dependencies
4. Add Mike as collaborator (pair programming)

B. Velocity & Burndown Predictions 📈
📈 Team Velocity Analysis

Historical Performance (Last 4 weeks):
- Week 1: 42h completed (of 45h estimated) = 93%
- Week 2: 38h completed (of 40h estimated) = 95%
- Week 3: 51h completed (of 48h estimated) = 106%
- Week 4: 45h completed (of 50h estimated) = 90%

Average Velocity: 96% of estimates
Trend: Stable ↔️

📊 Burndown Forecast:
Remaining Work: 180 hours
At current velocity: 188 hours needed
Projected Completion: Nov 22 (3 days late)

⚡ Acceleration Needed:
To meet Nov 18 deadline:
- Increase velocity to 110% OR
- Add 8 hours of capacity/week OR
- Reduce scope by 18 hours

C. Risk Scoring & Early Warnings ⚠️
🎯 Project Risk Assessment

OVERALL RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM-HIGH (65/100)

Risk Factors:
1. 🔴 Critical Path Vulnerability (20 points)
   - Single bottleneck task #52
   - No parallel alternatives
   
2. 🟡 Resource Constraints (15 points)
   - Sarah over-allocated 3 of 4 weeks
   - Limited team bench strength
   
3. 🟡 Estimation Accuracy (12 points)
   - 25% of tasks exceeded estimates
   - AI confidence scores: 3 low, 8 medium, 4 high
   
4. 🟢 Schedule Buffer (8 points)
   - Only 2-day buffer (should be 10%)
   
5. 🟡 Dependencies (10 points)
   - 8 tasks with 2+ dependencies
   - Potential cascade delays

🎯 Recommended Actions:
1. Add 1 team member for 2 weeks (↓25 risk points)
2. Create parallel path for Tasks #56-#59 (↓15 points)
3. Add 5-day buffer to critical path (↓8 points)

D. Workload Balancing Recommendations ⚖️
⚖️ Workload Optimization Analysis

Current Distribution:
Sarah: 85 hours (47%) 🔴 Overloaded
John:  52 hours (29%) 🟢 Balanced
Mike:  43 hours (24%) 🟡 Underutilized

Optimal Distribution (33% each):
Sarah: 60 hours (-25h) 
John:  60 hours (+8h)
Mike:  60 hours (+17h)

💡 Reallocation Plan:
MOVE TO JOHN:
- Task #47: API Integration (16h) - Good fit for John's backend expertise
- Task #61: Testing Suite (8h) - John has done similar work

MOVE TO MIKE:
- Task #52: UI Components (20h) - Mike is frontend specialist
- Task #45: Documentation (12h) - Lower complexity, good for Mike

Expected Outcome:
- Reduces Sarah's load to 57h (95% capacity)
- Balances team utilization
- Maintains skill-to-task alignment

E. What-If Scenario Analysis 🔮
🔮 Scenario Planning

SCENARIO 1: "Add Contractor"
Input: +1 contractor (20h/week, junior level)
Output:
- Project completion: Nov 12 (6 days earlier)
- Cost: $4,000
- Risk reduction: 15 points
- Best tasks: #45, #48, #51 (documentation, testing)

SCENARIO 2: "Reduce Scope"
Input: Defer 3 low-priority tasks (28 hours)
Output:
- Project completion: Nov 13 (5 days earlier)
- Cost: $0
- Risk reduction: 10 points
- Deferred: #67, #69, #71

SCENARIO 3: "Extend Deadline"
Input: Move deadline to Nov 25 (+7 days)
Output:
- Team stress: ↓40%
- Resource over-allocation: 0 conflicts
- Buffer time: 9 days (adequate)
- Risk level: LOW (25/100)

💡 Recommendation: Scenario 3
Extending the deadline provides the best risk/reward balance
without additional costs or scope reduction.
