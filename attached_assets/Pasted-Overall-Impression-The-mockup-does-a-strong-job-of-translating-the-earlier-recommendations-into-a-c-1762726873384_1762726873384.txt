Overall Impression
The mockup does a strong job of translating the earlier recommendations into a coherent visual system. The restrained palette, typographic hierarchy, and segmented control all feel aligned with the “enterprise-grade” direction you’re targeting. Below are more detailed notes and a handful of tweak suggestions to keep refining the polish.

Color Palette
Brand neutrals feel calm and professional. The mix of Neutral 200/400 for bars with the steel-blue primary keeps the chart grounded.

Check contrast on the accent gold (#f5d76e). On white backgrounds or over light grays it may not meet WCAG 4.5:1 for small text; consider either deepening it slightly or reserving it for icon fills/badges where contrast requirements are lower.

Semantic colors look intentional. The muted danger tone avoids alarm fatigue. Just ensure the warning orange has enough contrast on Neutral 50 backgrounds.

Typography
The system font stack is sensible and the size ladder reads cleanly.

Consider nudging Heading 1 down to 28 px (or increasing letter-spacing slightly) so it doesn’t overpower content on smaller modals; this also keeps spacing more consistent across pages.

For the 10 px bar labels, test at real data density; if labels will sometimes run longer than the bar width, you might need an ellipsis strategy or tooltip to avoid overlap.

Button & Segmented Control Styles
Primary/secondary/danger/ghost styles are cohesive, and icon spacing feels balanced.

Segmented control interaction is solid—nice touch with focus outlines. To improve affordance, you could soften the border radius to 6 px so it mirrors the button tokens (currently 6 px vs. 8 px visually).

Consider adding an “active” shadow inset or a subtle bottom border on the selected segment to reinforce the toggled state for keyboard users.

Gantt Bars & States
Gradients are tasteful; they add depth without going glossy.

The progress overlay at 60% is readable, but you may want to increase opacity slightly (e.g., 0.65) so the progress is more distinguishable when bars sit close together.

When implementing, ensure critical vs. milestone colors remain distinguishable to color-blind users—maybe add a thin top border or patterned fill for milestones.

Swim-Lane Preview
The structure is clear, and collapsible headers will help reduce scroll.

To emphasize group boundaries, consider adding a left accent bar (2 px in brand primary) or subtle shadow on expanded groups.

Task counts are helpful; pairing them with a lightweight progress indicator (e.g., completed vs. total) could make it even more actionable in the future.

Icon System
Font Awesome choices match the semantics you’re replacing. Double-check any places where you need outlined vs. solid styles to maintain consistency with surrounding UI density.

Spacing & Shadows
The spacing scale covers all the common increments. You might add a 3xl/48 px token for larger page sections if you foresee hero/header treatments.

Shadow tokens look appropriate. For accessibility, ensure focus states are still prominent when shadows are applied (especially on white backgrounds).

Suggested Next Tweaks
Run contrast checks on the accent gold and warning orange against Neutral 50/100 backgrounds.

Test a real-data screenshot overlay to confirm 10 px labels, gradients, and shadows remain crisp when exported to PNG/PDF (if that’s on the roadmap).

Document usage guidelines alongside the style tile (e.g., “Use Neutral 200 for card backgrounds only on dashboard views”) so future contributors follow the intended patterns.

Overall, the style tile is ready to approve with only minor refinements noted above
